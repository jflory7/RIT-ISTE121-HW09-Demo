RIT-ISTE121-HW09-Demo
=====================


## What

This repository is intended to be used for an in-class demo of using Git, how it works, and using it for a homework. It is paired with an [in-class presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YmOTkBa7w62LN8kqWmRzZiB9HJIthuBcF3Lw5JkgOM0/edit?usp=sharing) about the basics of using Git and GitHub.

For noting, a much larger example of a GitHub project might be [BungeeCord](https://github.com/SpigotMC/BungeeCord), a Minecraft server connector, or [Swift](https://github.com/apple/swift), Apple's programming language.
